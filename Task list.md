Task list:

-   "load" data for that product in customiser
-   When complete, instead of export, add item to cart with customisation data
-   When order is placed, make sure data is stored and retrievable
-   Item options and customised artwork should be separate

Thoughts:
When the customiser is completed:
to add to the cart, we need: - The product ID - The product options - The quantity - The user - The artwork
