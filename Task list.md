Task list:
- Make user go to customiser from product page
- Auth check before
- Only load customiser if product id is in URL
- "load" data for that product in customiser
- When complete, instead of export, add item to cart with customisation data
- When order is placed, make sure data is stored and retrievable 
- Item options and customised artwork should be separate

Thoughts:
When the customiser is completed:
to add to the cart, we need:
    - The product ID
    - The product options
    - The quantity
    - The user
    - The artwork
